# SkyTime

Back in 2011, I published an app to the App Store called "SkyTime". The app was designed to display the current
Julian Date and Sidereal time, which can be useful to astronomers. I animated some large digits at the top of the 
screen, included some basic code to discover location, and that was that.

Fast forward to 2016, and the app was woefully outdated. It looked very sad on newer, larger screens, although it
still worked fine.

I blew the dust off, and updated it to scale a little more nicely. I then quickly added support the Apple Watch.
Rather than then let it languish on my hard drive for another five years, I've popped it up here under MIT license
in case it's of use to anyone.
